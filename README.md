# RayTracing Lab
A simple ray tracing rendering engine made in C++ that I'm working on. It's just a hobby project (for now), and not an actual "product".

DOCS COMING SOON!

WORK IN PROGRESS!

I used the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) guide to get started. I recommend it.
